Used at Sunrise NYC for quick quote cards to put on our various social media platforms. Originally forked from [The Daily Pennsylvanian](https://github.com/dailypenn/outquote) and then made into its own repo as it became pretty divergent from the original code.

## Examples

Here's some of what Outquote can do!
